## About the Specialization

- **Specialization Title:** Statistics with Python  
- **Institution:** University of Michigan  
- **Platform:** Coursera  
- **Instructors:** Brenda Gunderson, Brady T. West, Kerby Shedden  
- **Language:** Spanish (AI Dubbing Available)  
- **Level:** Beginner  
- **Duration:** Approximately 4 weeks per course, 10 hours per week  

**Description:**  
This specialization introduces a modern, applied perspective to statistics using the Python programming language.  
You will learn to:
- Create and interpret data visualizations with Matplotlib and related Python libraries.  
- Apply and interpret inferential statistical procedures.  
- Use statistical modeling techniques such as linear and logistic regression, multilevel models, and Bayesian inference.  
- Connect research questions with appropriate data analysis methods.
